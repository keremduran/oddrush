# ODDRUSH

Casino was looking for a training application to practice the mental math for payouts specifically designed for dealers, because it could get quite difficult and stressful to mentally calculate payouts such $45 times 7, $135 times 1.5, in a real setting, while handling hundreds/thousands of dollars, within seconds.  

The game might not make a lot of sense to non-dealers, since I exactly replicated the casino rules from the view of a dealer, which takes multiple months of training to get used to. How the chips are broken down, how the order of denominations are placed on the tray, and how the odds are calculated, has been modeled after real casino operations.
